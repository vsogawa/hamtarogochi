Keep your hamster fed and happy! Giving him gifts will (almost always) make him pleased. But he hates bugs!

When he has no health left he becomes very grumpy.

He recovers health with a good gift or when he randomly takes a nap.
He loses health when he sees a bug and also over time as he gets hungry.
